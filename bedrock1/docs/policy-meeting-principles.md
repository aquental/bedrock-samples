## Principles
- Default to async; meetings are the exception.
- Agenda required; outcomes captured and shared.

## Cadences
- Standups ≤ 10 minutes.
- Decision reviews: doc-first; only decision-makers required.

## No-Go Windows
- Focus blocks 09:00–11:00 Tue–Thu (no recurring meetings).

## Cancel Criteria
- Missing agenda 12h prior.
- No decision required → convert to async thread.
